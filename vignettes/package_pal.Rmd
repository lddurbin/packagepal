Building packages in R can be tough, even for those of us who've made a few in the past. `packagepal` makes it a little easier in two ways: it has some functions to set you on the right path, and it provides a handy checklist of everything you need to think about as you progress with your package-building journey.

To get started with `packagepal`, call the following function and follow the instructions:

```{r starting, eval=FALSE}
packagepal::pal_start()
```

Alternatively, to see a check-list of recommendations for building a package, simply call:

```{r package_checklist, eval=FALSE}
packagepal::checklist()
```
