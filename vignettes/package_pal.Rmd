Building packages in R can be tough, even for those of us who've made a few in the past. `packagepal` makes it a little easier in two ways: it has a handy checklist of everything you need to think about as you progress with your package-building journey.


To get started with `packagepal`, simply call:

```{r package_checklist, eval=FALSE}
packagepal::checklist()
```
