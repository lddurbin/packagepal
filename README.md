## Acknowledgements

This package was inspired by Building Tidy Tools, a workshop delivered
by Emma Rand and Ian Lyttle at rstudio::conf(2022). Although I didn’t
attend this workshop myself, the slides are [freely available
online](https://rstudio-conf-2022.github.io/build-tidy-tools/) and
taught me how to make my first R package. I still refer to them all the
time.
